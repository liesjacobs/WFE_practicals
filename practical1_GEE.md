# Welcome to the first practical. 

In this practical we will be exploring the datasets and functionalities of Google Earth Engine. If all is well, you have created an account on earth engine by following the instructions on [getstarted](https://liesjacobs.github.io/WFE_practicals/)


## Step 1: exploring the interface

Now that you have your account, you can surf to the [code editor](code.earthengine.google.com/).
Your screen should look like this ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89069805/129699267-c9c03178-f0b5-41be-83d9-96596d36e61c.png)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/liesjacobs/WFE_practicals/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
