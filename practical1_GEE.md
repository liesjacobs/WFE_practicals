# Welcome to the first practical. 

In this practical we will be exploring the datasets and functionalities of Google Earth Engine. If all is well, you have created an account on earth engine by following the instructions on [getstarted](https://liesjacobs.github.io/WFE_practicals/)


## Step 1: exploring the interface

Now that you have your account, you can surf to the [code editor](code.earthengine.google.com/).
Your screen should look like this ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89069805/129699267-c9c03178-f0b5-41be-83d9-96596d36e61c.png)

The code editor basically consists of 4 windows: 
- On the bottom of the screen, you can see a basemap, and any spatial information you plot (see later for examples) will show here. 
- On the left you see a window depicting your scripts
- The middle of the screen is devoted to the script you are currently working on or running. At the beginning of your adventures, this is still blank. 
- On the right the panel shows either 'inspector', 'console' or 'tasks'. For now, the console is most important: here textual information or figures you wish to print or show are given. 


## Step 2: exploring the code

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/liesjacobs/WFE_practicals/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
